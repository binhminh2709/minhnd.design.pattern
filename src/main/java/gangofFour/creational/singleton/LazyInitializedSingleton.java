/**
 * Both eager initialization and static block initialization creates the instance even before itâ€™s being used and that is not the best practice to use. So in further sections, we will learn how to create Singleton class
 * that supports lazy initialization.
 *
 * The above implementation works fine incase of single threaded environment but when it comes to multithreaded systems, it can cause issues if multiple threads are inside the if loop at the same time. It will destroy
 * the singleton pattern and both threads will get the different instances of singleton class. In next section, we will see different ways to create a thread-safe singleton class.
